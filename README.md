# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice** repository!  

This repository contains my solutions and notes for **all key patterns** in DSA, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. The main goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and create a reference for future use.
